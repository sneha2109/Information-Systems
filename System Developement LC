Introduction :
Acquiring International Degree’s from renowned International Schools and Universities has been a trend amongst Students for more than a decade now. Students appear for entrance exams much before even their High school’s and Bachelor’s degree finish to get into their aspired and ambitious Foreign Universities to pursue either their Under Graduate or Graduate degree’s. This calls for Migration from their homeland to completely new Countries and new Cities in an entirely new culture and environment away from their families and friends. 
Issues Faced by International Student’s :
Being a student not everyone is as lucky when it comes to their housing situation. A study has shown that finding good quality and affordable accommodation is a big issue for exchange and international students in the USA. The Researchers identify nine key issues including predictable problems such as - language barriers and rental laws differing between countries. More seriously, they also reveal the housing scams targeting international students are not uncommon and that, overall, few people are aware of the severity of the housing challenges in international education. 
According to IEE i.e International Education Exchange reports, there are more than one million to be specific the number was 1,095,299 international students who came in the year 2018/19. So, coming to totally different country with different culture, lot of students face problems with Rental Apartments, Study Materials, Commute. 
Some of the common Issues faced by International Students –
•	International students are unable to get proper accommodation & housing even when their search for “A HOME begins from there HOME”. Many students reach the destination and wander for initial crucial months finding a comfortable accommodation and places to eat. They have to rely on Social Media Platform Pages for people to post about their apartments who are looking for flatmates and roommates.
•	Newly arrived students have to depend either upon there roommates, seniors or acquaintances in the city to find information about local facilities like Travel paths, Grocery stores, Stuff to buy for their new place. There situation becomes complex if they do not have many helping hands around them. They become helpless if there is no one to guide them.  
•	One such issue is lack of availability of study material for new students. Many students do not have access to books and study materials required for their particular course or semester. 
•	They either have to buy books spending money which is not economic many a times or have to search multiple portals for accessing books resulting into wastage of time.
•	There is no common platform available for students to get all information.
•	All these factors are affecting the students academic and also creates a stressful situation for their families.
